# Cookies

The challenge has given a website `http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/`. When we go to this website and use the option inspect by right-clicking the home tab. Then we have to go to applications and then the cookies option.
In that, I tried giving different values and it is showing different webpages.

in this, I give the value 2 and it shows me a different webpage.

Here I gave the value of 34, which showed me that it was not a valid cookie, so I started entering values less than 34.

Finally, when I gave the value 18, it gave me the flag.
