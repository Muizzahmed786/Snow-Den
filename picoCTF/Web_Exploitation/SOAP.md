In This challenge we have to read the `/etc/passwd` file from a web portal `http://saturn.picoctf.net:65146/`.
The hint provided in this challenge is regarding XML external entity Injection.

XML external entity injection, also known as XXE is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's
processing of XML data.

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that provides rules to define any data.

Now we have to pass the XML to  display the contents of `/etc/passwd` file.

Before passing the XML, first we have to intercept the request and then forward it to show the `/etc/passwd` file.
