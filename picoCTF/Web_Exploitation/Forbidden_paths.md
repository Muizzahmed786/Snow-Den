# Forbidden paths
The challenge asks me to get the flag, but the the program filters out absolute paths when given as input to it. Therfore, we have to use relative paths to open the text file and get the flag.
When we enter the absolute path of the file which is `/usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt` it gives the message as not authorized.
But when we enter `../../../../../../flag.txt` it reads the file and gives us the flag.

1.) Giving incorrect relative paths.


This is how I solved it.
