To try logging in I searched for `SQL injections to bypass authentication` and got this webpage `https://portswigger.net/support/using-sql-injection-to-bypass-authentication`
Where it has explained the different typre of SQL injection attacks.

Now to check for SQL injection vulnerability we have to enter single quote in the username area.
If any is present, it will show this kind of message.

In the above image we can see that one SQL query is given:- `SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='' AND password=''`.
the syntax to perform this query is `' or 1==1 -- -`.
`--` this is called thecomment sequence.
Upon entering this in the username section. We are now logged in.
