In this challenge we are given a morse-code audio and we decode it.
we are given a hint that we have to use audacity to decode the audio.

Upon the uploading the file on Audacity I got this:-

As we can see in the image the hiphens and full stops are present.

morse text I recieved:- `.-- .... ....- --...  .... ....- --... ....  ----. ----- -..  .-- .-- ----- ..- ----. .... --...`
decoded message:- `WH47H47H90DWW0U9H7`.
when I tried this, it was the incorrect answer.

I tried some other online decoder `https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html`.
decoded message:- `WH47 H47H 90D W20U9H7`

FLAG:- `picoCTF{wh47_h47h_90d_w20u9h7}`.
