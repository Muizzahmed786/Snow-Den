# C3

in this challenge we are given a custom cyclical cipher.
We are given the encoder and the ciphertext.
ciphertext :- `DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl`
the encoder is given below:-
```bash
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
to create a decryption file, we can try reversing the process.
in the for loop the `char` will take values from `lookup2` instead of `lookup1` and replace `-` with `+`.
And lastly, `prev` which takes the previous value will be set to `current`.
The decrypted is given below :-
```bash
import sys
chars = ""

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

decrypt = ""
prev = 0

for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    current = (cur + prev) % 40
    decrypt += lookup1[current]
    prev = current

print(decrypt)
```

when we run this with `ciphertext` as the input we get the folowing output:-
```bash
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
now if we look at one the comments in this, it says about self input, so we might have to use this as input to this program itself.
while running it a syntax error occured because originally the brackets were missing in `print`.
the output:- 
```bash
a
d
l
i
b
s
```
