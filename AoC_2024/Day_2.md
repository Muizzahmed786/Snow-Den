# Day 2

## Learnings
1.) Getting an idea about True Positives and False Positives.
2.) SIEM (Security Information and event management) :- It is a single source where all the security information and events are present and monitored.
3.) An alert is considered a True Positive if it contains actual malicious activity.
4.) If the alert triggers because of an activity that is not actually malicious, it is considered an False Positive.
5.) On way by which we can classify the alert as TP or FP is just by confirming with the current user about the activity.
